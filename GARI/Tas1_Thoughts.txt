1. Read about API documentation.

2. Create a Request URL and test it using POSTMAN.

3. Create a code in python that fetches the required Data using request library.
    - Bear in mind the necesity to send a request for each year, since the API
      supports just one year per request; for that, the easiest way is using a
      for loop that uses each valuo on a list of years.
    - Consider formatting the list created with the country codes into a string
      that is suported withing the reques URL string.

4. Clean the obtained data into a data set using just the required columns
   and infrmation.
    - Get the relevant data from the JSON in the response data.
    - Extract and label the new data for each iteration year and append it to the new
      data set.

5. Organize the information using pandas.
    - Confert data set into a data frame.
    - Group data by name.
    - Group data by trade value.
    - get the top 10 and the bottom 10 of the data frame.

8. Use matplot library to visualize the organized data.
    - Use formatting variables to set the data in an easy way for preventing overlaping
      of showed information.
    - Format the total trade values for displayin them in a shorter way for easyness.
